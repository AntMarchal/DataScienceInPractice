    "**Before starting the feature selection per se, we do a little of feature engineering**:\n",
    "- **Create a new variable 'MonthlyExpense' = 'TotalCharges'/'tenure'**: As we are interested in the lifetime value of the contracts, we can compute the average monthly expense of each customer. The lifetime value of the contracts could be extrapolated from the average lifetime of the contracts. Therefore the feature selection will consist in identifying which features have the most explanatory power regarding this new feature 'MonthlyExpense'. As we already expect, by construction, some features such as 'TotalCharges', 'tenure' and 'MonthlyCharges' will certainly be highly correlated with 'MonthlyExpense' and could be discarded in the subsequent feature importance analysis in order to obtain a better resolution of the other features contribution to our dependent variable.\n",
    "- **Transform the categorical variable into numerical values**: Indeed as we have seen during de preliminary data inspection, we have a lot of categorical feature that we will need to map to numerical value. When it is a binary value, e.g. yes/no or male/female we can directly replace it by 0 or 1. When there is more possibility like for the 'contract' feature we will use the pd.factorize() function to establish a numerical mapping. Furthermore, notice that some feature present redundant information such as the 'No phone service' information that is already present in the 'PhoneService' feature and the 'No internet service' present in all the internet related services features that could be placed in a separated feature: 'InternetService' under the form of True or False (an additional column will be created for 'Fiber'->True/False). Proceeding this way most of the categorical feature will become binary except 'contract' and 'payement method'."
